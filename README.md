### **Project Overview**

**Pantasa** is a Tagalog grammar correction system that combines rule-based error detection with deep learning-based iterative error correction. The goal of this project is to create an accurate and efficient grammar checker for the Tagalog language.

---

### **Getting Started**

#### Step 1: Clone the Repository

Start by cloning the Pantasa project repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/BJCul/Pantasa.git
cd pantasa
```

#### Step 2: Set up a Virtual Environment

It is highly recommended to use a virtual environment to manage dependencies:

```bash
# Install virtualenv if you don't have it
pip install virtualenv

# Create a virtual environment in the project root
virtualenv pantasa_env

# Activate the environment (Windows)
pantasa_env\Scripts\activate

# Activate the environment (Linux/Mac)
source pantasa_env/bin/activate
```

#### Step 3: Install Dependencies

Install the required Python libraries listed in `requirements.txt`:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### **Branching Workflow**

We use a **Gitflow-inspired** branching strategy to manage the development workflow. This ensures that the `main` branch remains stable, while development happens in separate branches.

#### 1. **Main Branch** (`main`)

The `main` branch contains the latest stable version of the project. No direct commits are allowed in the `main` branch. All changes must come from feature branches through **pull requests**.

#### 2. **Feature Branches**

Create a new branch for each feature or bug fix. Always branch off from `main` and name your branch according to the feature or issue you're working on. Example branch names:
- `feature/error-detection`
- `feature/file-upload`
- `bugfix/preprocessing-tokenization`

#### Step 1: Pull Latest Changes from `main`

Before creating a new branch, ensure your local `main` branch is up-to-date with the remote repository.

```bash
git checkout main
git pull origin main
```

#### Step 2: Create a New Branch

Create a new branch for the feature you are working on:

```bash
git checkout -b feature/<feature-name>
```

Example:

```bash
git checkout -b feature/error-detection
```

#### Step 3: Push the Feature Branch to Remote

After making some commits, push the branch to the remote repository:

```bash
git push origin feature/<feature-name>
```

---

### **Making Contributions**

#### Step 1: Work on Your Feature

Make your changes to the codebase, following the project‚Äôs structure and conventions. Ensure that each unit of work is logically grouped into separate commits.

#### Step 2: Stage Your Changes

When you're ready to commit, stage the changes using:

```bash
git add <file-name>
```

Alternatively, to add all modified files:

```bash
git add .
```

#### Step 3: Commit Your Changes

Write descriptive and concise commit messages:

```bash
git commit -m "Implement hybrid n-gram error detection"
```

Follow the [Commit Message Guidelines](#commit-message-guidelines) to ensure consistency.

#### Step 4: Push Your Changes

Push your changes to the remote feature branch:

```bash
git push origin feature/<feature-name>
```

---

### **Handling Conflicts**

If your branch has conflicts with the `main` branch, follow these steps to resolve them:

#### Step 1: Switch to Your Branch

```bash
git checkout feature/<feature-name>
```

#### Step 2: Pull the Latest Changes from `main`

```bash
git pull origin main
```

#### Step 3: Resolve Conflicts

Git will alert you if there are any conflicts. Open the conflicting files, resolve the issues manually, and then add the resolved files:

```bash
git add <file-name>
```

#### Step 4: Commit the Merge

```bash
git commit -m "Resolve merge conflicts"
```

---

### **Pull Request Guidelines**

Once you‚Äôve finished working on your feature, create a **pull request** (PR) to merge your feature branch into the `main` branch.

#### Step 1: Create a Pull Request

1. Go to the GitHub repository and click on the "Pull Requests" tab.
2. Click **New Pull Request**.
3. Select your feature branch as the **compare** branch and `main` as the **base** branch.

#### Step 2: Complete the Pull Request

1. Write a detailed description of the changes introduced by your branch.
2. Request reviews from other team members.
3. Ensure that your branch has no merge conflicts with `main`.
4. After approval, the branch will be merged into `main`.

---

### **Testing Your Code**

Before submitting a pull request, run tests to ensure that your changes do not break existing functionality.

#### Step 1: Run Unit Tests

Navigate to the `tests/` directory and run the unit tests:

```bash
python -m unittest discover tests
```

Ensure that all tests pass before submitting your pull request.

#### Step 2: Add New Tests

If your feature introduces new functionality, add tests to cover that feature in the `tests/` directory. For example:
- `tests/test_preprocessing.py`
- `tests/test_error_detection.py`

---

### **Commit Message Guidelines**

Please follow these commit message guidelines to keep the Git history clean and readable:

1. **Start with a verb**: Use a verb to describe the change. Example verbs: "Add", "Fix", "Implement", "Refactor", etc.
2. **Be concise and descriptive**: Example: `"Implement hybrid n-gram error detection"`
3. **Use imperative mood**: Example: `"Fix bug in preprocessing tokenization"`

---

### **Example Contribution Workflow**

Here‚Äôs a typical workflow example:

1. **Sync your local `main`**:
   ```bash
   git checkout main
   git pull origin main
   ```

2. **Create a new branch**:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/error-detection
   ```

3. **Make changes and commit**:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Implement hybrid n-gram error detection"
   ```

4. **Push to the remote repository**:
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/error-detection
   ```

5. **Create a pull request** on GitHub:
   - Go to the "Pull Requests" tab, compare the branch with `main`, and create a PR.

6. **Address feedback** (if necessary), fix conflicts, and merge the PR after approval.
